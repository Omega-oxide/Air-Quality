            For our project, we made a temperature and humidity sensor using a
            Raspberry Pi that was integrated with an Adafruit BME280 sensor.
            This sensor monitors the temperature and humidity of the environment
            around itself and reports this data. Temperature and humidity impact
            the air quality and a need for affordable and reliable air quality
            systems grows. Our project addresses this need with the development
            of an air quality sensor that is low cost using Raspberry Pi and has
            an accurate collection of real-time data for checking air quality.
