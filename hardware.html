            <p>This is the board pictured to the left, with all the soldering and pins to boot.
                This is the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and BME280 connected with the basic soldering kit's cords.</p>
            <p>Pictured first on the right here is a closer look at the soldering to the BME280 the first thing we soldered.
                It took some time but turned out great!</p>
            <p>Furthest on the right is a closer look at the soldering from the board the last part we soldered.</p>
            <p>It is a decent board despite its issues. One of which was the proprietary micro cords which were a bit of trouble to get a hold of. Online is probably
                the only good place to get them so look there first. Lastly third-party cheap cords, such as the USB coupling, failed to yield any hardware interactivity.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="centered-paragraph">The Air Quality does advocate for getting and working with a board like this,
            just know the hoops you may have to jump through for it to work with your own hardware on hand.
