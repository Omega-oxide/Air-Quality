            <p class="right-paragraph">This is the board pictured to the left, with all the soldering and pins to boot.<br>
                This is the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 and BME280 connected with the basic soldering kit's cords.<br>
            <br>Pictured first on the right here is a closer look at the soldering to the BME280 the first thing we soldered.
                It took some time but turned out great!<br>
            <br>Furthest on the right is a closer look at the soldering from the board the last part we soldered.<br>
            <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
            <br>It is a decent board despite its issues. One of which was the proprietary micro cords which were a-bit trouble to get a hold of. Online is probably
                the only good place to get them so look there first.<br>
                Lastly third party cheap cords, such as the usb coupling, failed to yield any hardware interactivity.

    <p class="centered-paragraph">The Air Quality does advocate for getting and working with a board like this,
        just know the hoops you may have to jump throw for it to work with your own hardware on hand
